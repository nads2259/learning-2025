# Module 5: Advanced Python & Systems Concepts

## Week 1: Deep Dive into the Interpreter
- Trace Python execution from source to bytecode
- Explore the CPython runtime, pycache, and disassembly tools
- Explain compilation steps, import mechanisms, and module caching
- Lab: Inspect bytecode using `dis` and optimize critical paths

## Week 2: Memory Management & Performance
- Understand reference counting, garbage collection, and memory pools
- Diagnose leaks with tracemalloc, objgraph, and memory profilers
- Benchmark code with `timeit`, `cProfile`, and line profilers
- Lab: Optimize a data processing script for speed and memory

## Week 3: Advanced Language Features
- Utilize decorators, context managers, metaclasses, and descriptors
- Implement iterators, generators, coroutines, and async/await patterns
- Design extensible APIs and plugin architectures
- Lab: Build an asynchronous data ingestion pipeline

## Week 4: Packaging & Distribution
- Structure production-ready packages, manage dependencies, and publish to PyPI
- Integrate C/C++ extensions with ctypes/cffi and cython basics
- Discuss deployment targets (serverless, containers, on-premise)
- Lab: Package a library, generate documentation, and automate releases

## Assessments & Deliverables
- Advanced Python code review
- Performance optimization report
- Module portfolio: asynchronous ETL package with benchmark results
