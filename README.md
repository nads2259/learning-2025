# Learning 2025: Data Analyst Journey

This repository captures the curriculum, resources, and roadmap for the **Learning 2025** program. The course is designed to transition learners from foundational IT knowledge to job-ready data analysts through a structured, 28-week experience.

## Program Pillars
- **IT Foundations:** Master networking (IP, TCP/IP vs. OSI), client-server models, and core security practices.
- **Engineering Excellence:** Adopt software development life cycles, Agile/DevOps practices, and collaboration tooling.
- **Python Mastery:** Progress from syntax basics to interpreter internals, memory management, concurrency, and packaging.
- **Analytical Impact:** Apply Python to real-world datasets, craft compelling narratives, and deliver stakeholder-ready insights.
